# Goal Oriented Image Quality Assessment Using CNN

## Abstract
Traditional image quality assessment (IQA) methods often fall short in precision when tailored specifically for evaluating images intended for subsequent computer vision tasks. This research introduces a goal-oriented image quality assessment (GO-IQA) framework, designed specifically for depth estimation applications. Utilizing the NYU-Depth-v2 dataset, which has been augmented with blur and various types of noise, the study reflects realistic image quality challenges encountered in the field. Our approach leverages the "Depth Anything" algorithm to generate depth-related mean squared error (MSE) scores, which serve as goal-specific quality metrics. BRISQUE analysis is employed to quantify the effects of image degradation. To predict MSE scores directly from images, multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures were developed and assessed. The results reveal a strong correlation between CNN-predicted scores and actual image quality in the context of depth estimation. The study also evaluates the time efficiency of this algorithm in identifying poor-quality images, thereby streamlining depth estimation processes. Ultimately, this work establishes foundational principles for the development of robust GO-IQA systems using CNNs, aimed at enhancing image quality assessment for depth estimation and similar applications.
